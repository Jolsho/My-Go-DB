The purpose of building this project was initially as an embedded database. Eventually I decided to go with a pre-built solution, but this was a valuable excercise nonetheless. The main modules are in core. There you can find cache, engine, fsm(free-space-manager), indexing, logger, pages, unix syscalls, the main table struct, and various types and interfaces. After managing to get insert/deletions/selects at scale I started checking benchmarks, and realized that there was a ton of memory being allocated once breaking the 4 digit operations/second mark. From there I sort of lost interest in the project, and moved onto other things.

There is still some work to do in here, but for the most part I accomplished and learned what I needed to already. For example the WAL exists, but its very minimal, and the recovery mechanism isn't finished. On the other hand there is per table write access, because of a specific architectural approach. I never ended up building out the api for the database either, but the generic foundations have already been laid through the table struct, so if I ever come back to this it wont be that difficult.
